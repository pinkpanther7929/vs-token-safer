/*
 * vs-token-safer — MCP server (thin adapter over core.js).
 * Forces code search through an official language server's index (clangd for C++, the Roslyn/C# LSP)
 * instead of Bash grep, and TOKEN-CAPS the result to a compact file:line list (no source bodies).
 *
 * All tool logic lives in core.js (shared with the CLI at cli.js, `vts`) so there is exactly one
 * implementation per tool. This file only maps MCP requests to runTool(). runTool is ASYNC (LSP is
 * async); the handler awaits it. Each LSP backend is spawned lazily and cached for the process — we
 * dispose clients on shutdown so no language-server child is left running.
