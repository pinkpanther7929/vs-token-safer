# vs-token-safer — Claude rules

Force code search through an **official language server's index** (clangd for C++, a Roslyn-based C# LSP)
instead of Bash grep, and **token-cap** the result to a compact `file:line` list. The
Visual-Studio / IDE-agnostic sibling of `rider-mcp-enforcer`. Local-only. Ships as MCP server + CLI
(`vts`). npm package + plugin name: `vs-token-safer`.

## First, orient (every session)
1. Read this file, then `node eval/run.mjs` — must print `EVAL PASSED` (41/41) before you change anything.
2. Resume context lives in: this file · the wiki (`wiki_query "vs-token-safer"`, pages under
   `.omc/wiki/`) · memory anchor `project-vs-token-safer`. The wiki **Status and TODO** page is the
   live checklist.

## What's true
- **Engine = official, glue = ours.** clangd (LLVM) / Roslyn (MS) do the analysis; we only write the
  LSP↔MCP glue. Never reuse a 3rd-party MCP server over source; never reimplement Roslyn.
- **Local-only, zero transmission.** Same trust model as the other plugins. The token-cap returns
  `file:line` (no bodies) → less raw source reaches the model than grep-and-paste.
- **Async.** `runTool` is async (LSP is async). MCP/CLI adapters must `await` and `disposeClients()`.
- **Naming umbrella.** "token-safer" is deliberately broad — more token-saving features/backends can be
  added under this name beyond C++/C# search.

## Layout
- `server/lsp.js` — generic LSP client (JSON-RPC/stdio). The one new, careful piece. `didOpen` is
  open-or-refresh: first call → `didOpen(v1)`, a re-call on an already-open doc → `didChange` (bumped
  version, current disk text) so a file changed after warm-up isn't answered from a stale buffer; a
  since-deleted file → `didClose`. Position tools re-call `didOpen` before each query, so hover/goto/
  outline/rename always re-read the file. The LSP engine keeps UNOPENED files fresh itself (clangd
  file-watch + background re-index); our warmset caches self-invalidate (include-graph by mtime,
  query-history by re-record; `_censusCache` is process-lifetime → restart/re-setup to refresh).
  LSP-spec conformance: server→client requests get shape-correct replies (`_serverRequestReply`:
  `workspace/configuration`→array, `workspace/applyEdit`→`{applied:false}`, `window/showDocument`→
  `{success:false}`, void reqs→null, unknown→MethodNotFound -32601); a timed-out request sends
  `$/cancelRequest`; client declares `synchronization` + `workspace.configuration` capabilities.
- `server/backends/index.js` — clangd/roslyn/typescript/pyright spawn configs + `pickBackend(root)`
  (detect order: compile_commands→clangd > .sln/.csproj→roslyn > tsconfig/package.json→typescript >
  pyproject/*.py→pyright; strongest build-artifact first). MIXED-REPO FIX: a query that TARGETS a file uses
  `backendForPath(a.path)` (core.js — ext→backend: .py→pyright, .ts/.js→typescript, .cpp/.h→clangd, .cs→
  roslyn) BEFORE `pickBackend(root)`, so a `.py`/`.ts` file inside a clangd-rooted UE/C++ tree gets pyright/
  typescript instead of clangd (else the query hits the wrong LSP, finds nothing, model abandons vts).
  Precedence: explicit `a.backend` > `VTS_BACKEND` > `backendForPath(a.path)` > `pickBackend(root)`. Eval guard 55.
  Override via `VTS_CLANGD_CMD/ARGS`,
  `VTS_ROSLYN_CMD/ARGS`, `VTS_TS_CMD/ARGS`, `VTS_PY_CMD/ARGS`. `winShell` flag spawns the npm `.cmd`
  shims (ts/pyright) through a shell on Windows. `langIdForPath` (lsp.js) maps file ext → LSP languageId.
  `findProjectRoot(start)` — bounded walk UP from a file to the nearest project marker (compile_commands/
  *.uproject/.sln/.csproj/tsconfig/package.json/pyproject/…/.git as the repo-boundary fallback; nearest
  dir wins, never climbs past a `.git`). Feeds `resolveRoot` (core.js) so a per-call `path` pins the right
  repo on a globally-installed server.
- `server/core.js` — `runTool()` dispatch, token-cap formatters, savings ledger. Tools: `search_symbol`,
  `find_references` (accepts EITHER a 0-based `path`+`line`+`character` position OR a `symbol` NAME — the
  code-modification primitive: by-name resolves the decl via `c.symbol` [exact-name-then-`path`-endsWith
  ranking], `didOpen`s it, queries references at `location.range.start`; no indexed decl → `scanTextUnder`
  literal-usage fallback. Discover showed name-driven usage hunts = the top bypass; this collapses the
  locate→position→refs dance that pushed the model to grep), `goto_definition`, `hover`, `document_symbols`,
  `rename` (LSP; preview by default, `apply=true` writes); SYMBOL-LEVEL EDITING (Serena-parity, the mutating
  set — all preview-by-default, `apply=true` writes): `replace_symbol_body` / `insert_after_symbol` /
  `insert_before_symbol` / `safe_delete` — `resolveSymbolForEdit` (core.js) resolves a declaration by NAME via
  the LSP outline (`documentSymbol`'s `.range` = whole body, `.selectionRange` = name; `path` pins the file
  else the index resolves it, optional `line` disambiguates), then splices text at the span via
  `applyEditsToText` (`symbolEditResult` shared preview/apply, reuses the rename read-only/Perforce note).
  `safe_delete` refuses while the symbol is still referenced (refs at the name) unless `force=true`. Token win:
  edit by naming a symbol instead of Read-ing the whole file + line-counting for an exact-match Edit. Eval guard
  52; `find_files`, `search_text`
  (filesystem — sanctioned `find`/`grep` replacements, no backend needed; `search_text` TARGETING: `path=<file>`
  searches one named file / `glob=<pat>` matching files — naming it AUTO-INCLUDES that extension (a `.md` etc),
  no docs flag; `docs=true` (no path/glob) widens the project-wide sweep to README/docs/config exts — default
  stays code-only. The grep-block hook reroutes a file-targeted text grep [`grep X README.md`] → `vts text
  --path README.md` via `buildDocsGrepRewrite`, rewrite-only never blocks); `vts_git`,
  `vts_p4` (OUTPUT COMPACTION, not index — run the real `git`/`p4` and group/dedup/cap the result via
  `server/compact.js`: git status→by change-type+dir, log→one line/commit, diff→per-file +/- diffstat;
  p4 opened/status/reconcile→by action+depot-dir, changes→terse. The rtk slice under our roof + ledger;
  the grep-block hook reroutes a single read-only `git status|log|diff` / `p4 opened|status|changes|reconcile`
  here via `buildVcsRewrite` — never blocks, `VTS_COMPACT_VCS=0` disables. `git grep` stays a CODE search.
  CLI `vts git/p4` are full arg passthrough → run in cwd, no `--projectPath`); `vts_warmup`, `vts_setup`,
  `vts_config`, `vts_savings` (RTK-gain-style: `graph`/`daily`/`history` + est. USD over timestamped day
  buckets), `vts_savings_reset`, `vts_discover` (scans `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` for code searches that
  BYPASSED vts → missed-token report + catch-rate; `learn=true` feeds their result files into the warm-set;
  ALSO MEASURES THE EDIT HABIT — `classifyDeclEdit` (server/edit-detect.js, SHARED with the enforcement hook)
  flags a built-in Edit/MultiEdit whose `old_string` is a whole declaration (replace → `replaceDecl`) OR whose
  `new_string` is (add → `insertDecl`) on a code file (≥`VTS_EDIT_MIN_LINES`+decl cue), and attributes that
  file's PRIOR Read tokens [`reads`/`readUse` Read↔Edit correlation in `scanBypasses`, read counted ONCE] = the
  read a symbol-edit would've skipped → `edit habit:` line; ALSO `editUnreached` = how many had NO prior vts
  search on that file [`searchUse`/`searchedBn` basename match] = the fraction the search-result steer CAN'T
  reach. Measured 30d: 1284 whole-decl edits, ~468k tok read-first, 1194/1284 (93%) search-unreachable). STEER
  is THREE layers, soft→hard (Edit-rewrite impossible: cross-tool `updatedInput` can't switch Edit→MCP, and the
  read is sunk by Edit time so a block recovers nothing — only a LEARNING signal): (B) `EDIT_STEER` on a FOCUSED
  `search_symbol` (≤`VTS_EDIT_STEER_MAX` 10) / `goto_definition` result (`VTS_EDIT_STEER=0` hides); (L1) the
  grep-block hook now also matches `Edit|MultiEdit` — a whole-decl replace/insert gets a MODEL-VISIBLE
  `emitWarn` with a READY symbol-edit call (`replace_symbol_body`/`insert_after_symbol`, `declSymbolName`
  best-effort names it), `VTS_EDIT_WARN=0` off; (L2) OPT-IN escalation, `VTS_EDIT_BLOCK_AFTER` DEFAULT 0=OFF — set ≥1 and once the
  adoption ledger's ignore-`streak` hits it, a SAFE insert (`insertDecl && !replaceDecl` — `insert_after_symbol`
  can't corrupt) is BLOCKED ONCE (exit 2) then `resetStreak()` (fire-once, NOT a wall — a permanent block
  TRAPPED the agent: it fought the wall with Edit retries / code contortions instead of switching, and each
  blocked attempt re-escalated the streak; live-reproduced on US editing edit-ledger.js); a replace stays warn. ADOPTION LEDGER (server/edit-ledger.js, `~/.vs-token-safer/
  edit-adoption.json`, `VTS_EDIT_LEDGER` override): hook records `builtin-warn` (streak++), core.js records
  `symbol-edit` on every symbol-edit dispatch (streak→0); `hooks/edit-report.js` (SessionStart) re-injects the
  adoption % as a goal = the SkillOpt-style measure→re-inject loop (static skill can't self-improve, a
  re-injected live metric can). Eval guards 53 (steer+discover) + 54 (L1/L2 hook); `eval/test-edit-steer.mjs`.
  `find_files`/`search_text` write a recovery TEE file (`VTS_TEE_DIR`, default on-truncate) when a result is
  capped so the full set is recoverable without re-running; a capped `search_symbol`/`find_references`
  ("… N more") tees too (`teeOverflow` — the rows are already in memory, no re-query). The ledger
  aggregates PER TOOL (`by tool:` line in `vts savings`) so you can see where the win comes from. BOOT AUTO-LEARN (`index.js`, `VTS_AUTO_LEARN`
  default on when projectPath set): 3s after boot, `autoLearn(root, 7)` (core.js, shares `scanBypasses`
  with discover) harvests bypassed-search result files into query-history — the self-improvement loop runs
  unattended every server start.
- `agents/code-locator.md` — context-isolated locator subagent (delegates a lookup, returns only file:line).
- `server/compact.js` — PURE output-compaction fns (`compactGit`/`compactP4`, string→string, no spawn) for the
  `vts_git`/`vts_p4` wrappers. Eval exercises them on canned input (deterministic). (No grep compaction here —
  grep reroutes to search_text, which scans + token-caps itself; there is no raw grep output to compact.)
- `server/cli.js` — `vts <cmd>`. `server/index.js` — MCP server (async handler → `await runTool`). PER-CALL
  ROOT: `resolveRoot(a)` (core.js) replaces the old single-pin `a.projectPath || PROJECT_PATH || cwd` for
  every query — precedence: explicit `projectPath` > a `path`'s enclosing project (`findProjectRoot`, only
  when OUTSIDE every known root so an inside-path keeps clangd's compile-DB rooting) > an MCP workspace root
  > `PROJECT_PATH` > cwd. `resolveCwdRoot(a)` for git/p4 (MCP root beats server cwd; pin still ignored). One
  global server now serves every repo a session touches, not just the pinned one. index.js does the MCP
  `roots` handshake (`getClientCapabilities`→`listRoots`→`setMcpRoots`, re-fetched on `roots/list_changed`,
  undefined-safe on old SDKs); no roots advertised → collapses to the old `PROJECT_PATH || cwd`. Boot
  prewarm/auto-learn use `PROJECT_PATH || first MCP root` so a config-less install warms the current
  workspace (ONE root only). BACKEND POOL (memory guard for dynamic roots): the `clients` map is BOUNDED —
  `VTS_MAX_BACKENDS` (2) LRU-evicts the least-recently-used idle client past the cap, `VTS_BACKEND_IDLE_MS`
  (300000, 0=off) reaps idle clients via an unref'd sweep; a client with an in-flight request (`pending.size`)
  is never evicted/reaped. Steady state ≈ 1 warm backend; bouncing 2 repos keeps both warm; a 3rd evicts LRU.
  `__pool` test surface + eval guards 45 (pool) / 46 (root resolution).
- `server/sdk.js` — createRequire MCP-SDK resolution. `server/ensure-deps.mjs` — SessionStart installer.
- `server/warmset.js` — prewarm ORDERING: `orderForWarm` (query-history > working-now [`git status` /
  `p4 opened`] > git-log recency > include-centrality [adaptive: prefix-read + `VTS_CENTRALITY_BUDGET_MS`
  + persistent include-graph cache that grows across warmups; `VTS_CENTRALITY_MAX` bounds the loop] > mtime) +
  `recordQueryResults`. Steers clangd's open-set so the warm window hits likely queries; git + Perforce.
  Used by `backends/index.js` afterInit + `core.js` (records result files per search). Also LANGUAGE-MIX
  warm sizing: `languageCensus(root)` (cached file-count per backend lang, skips node_modules/build/...),
  `warmCap(root,backend,env,base)` (per-backend open-cap scales to that lang's file count × `VTS_WARM_CAP_RATIO`,
  clamped `[base,VTS_WARM_CAP_MAX]`; explicit `VTS_*_OPEN_CAP` wins), and `prewarmBackends(root,picked)`
  (`VTS_PREWARM_BACKENDS` auto→[dominant] / `all`→every detected lang dominant-first / comma-list). `index.js`
  boot warms each selected backend with its adaptive cap → a multi-lang repo warms in language proportion.
- `hooks/block-code-grep.js` + `hooks.json` — grep-block. A Bash code search (grep/rg/ack/ag/findstr/
  `git grep`/`find -name`) that is a SINGLE safe segment is REWRITTEN to the equivalent `vts` CLI command via
  PreToolUse `updatedInput` (token-capped, flow unbroken); anything ambiguous (pipeline, unsafe pattern,
  quote in the root) falls back to the exit-2 block. Segment splitting is QUOTE-AWARE (`splitSegments` in
  `server/shell-split.js`, SHARED with `vts discover` so enforcement and measurement agree): a `|` inside
  quotes is pattern, not pipeline — so `grep "FooA|FooB"` / `grep "^#include"` (the top bypass shapes per
  `vts discover`) rewrite to `vts text` (regex); inside double quotes `\"` is an escaped literal; SAFE_TEXT
  allows `| ^ #` (always double-quoted; `$`/space/backslash still rejected). `grepNudgeFor` embeds a
  READY-TO-USE equivalent call (identifier→search_symbol, regex→search_text) in every Grep nudge/block.
  GREP-TOOL enforcement v2 (A+) + v2.1: a clear SYMBOL HUNT is BLOCKED (exit 2) and routed to search_symbol/
  search_text per `isSymbolHuntGrep` — (1) a bare identifier, (2) a regex with a code-structural cue (`::` /
  literal `(` / `void·class·struct·enum·template`), OR (3) **v2.1** an ALTERNATION (`A|B|C`) carrying a
  CamelCase/snake identifier (`MaxWalkSpeed|MaxExcessSpeed`, `get_value|set_value`) — the top measured bypass
  (UE type/symbol enumeration). KEPT as warn (false-positive-safe): freeform single tokens, AND keyword
  alternations (`TODO|FIXME`/`GET|POST` — ALL-CAPS, no lower→upper transition, so no CamelCase signal). The
  reroute is search_text (same regex, token-capped) → no wrong/missing results, just friction. `VTS_GREP_BLOCK=0`
  reverts all of it to warn-only. Measured: v2 block ~172k tok/30d; v2.1 adds ~319k (CamelCase alternation).
  GLOB/Search TOOL (filename search) **v2.2**: a CONCRETE code-file glob (`*.cpp` / `Foo.h` / `**/Bar.*` per
  `isBlockableGlob`) is BLOCKED → `find_files` (which is a DIFFERENT tool — can't updatedInput-rewrite a Glob —
  so it's a block with a ready-to-use `find_files q=… projectPath=<dir hint from the glob/path>`); a bare
  `*`/`**/*` or code-DIR glob stays a warn. The warn alone was IGNORED — the model kept Glob-ing a giant UE tree
  and narrowing the path instead of switching (live dogfood). find_files/search_text are walk-BOUNDED: shared
  `SKIP_DIRS` (node_modules/Intermediate/Binaries/Saved/build/… ) + a 4s time box so a huge tree can't hang them.
  FIND-DIR FIX (v2.2): a Bash `find <dir> -name X` rewrite now HONORS `<dir>` as the find_files root
  (`extractFindDir`) — it was dropped, so `find /abs/UE/path -name X` searched the configured vts repo and falsely
  reported "No files" (a live correctness bug on a UE worktree). `vts discover` also counts the Glob tool as a
  find_files bypass. `VTS_REWRITE=0` → block
  instead of rewrite; `excludeCommands` (config) / `VTS_EXCLUDE_COMMANDS` (csv) opt a command out; escape hatch
  `VTS_ENFORCE=0`. Messages i18n'd (`uiLang()`: Korean when `VTS_LANG`/config `lang`=`ko` OR OS locale `ko-*`,
  else English; `VTS_LANG=en|ko` forces). Copy is AGENT-DIRECTED — the actionable part instructs the assistant
  ("re-run with the vts tool matching the intent" + the concrete call), with a brief human-facing reassurance
  that the red box is a redirect ("hold on"), not a failure — the hook output is consumed by the MODEL, which
  is the one that re-runs, not a human picking from a menu.
- `skills/vs-search/SKILL.md` — routing. `commands/{setup,savings}.md`.
- `eval/run.mjs` + `eval/_mock-lsp.mjs` — mock-LSP eval (no toolchain). Add a guard for every new path.
- Config dir `~/.vs-token-safer`, env prefix `VTS_`. MCP server name `vs-search`.

## Conventions (inherited — non-negotiable)
- **Token-first.** Every feature must keep/raise the token win. Output is `file:line`, capped, no bodies.
  Add an `eval/run.mjs` guard for anything new.
- **No proprietary leak.** Never put real paths/symbols/company names in the repo or commits; sanitize;
  scan tree + git log before any push. Eval/docs use synthetic names only.
- **Security/local-only.** No network calls; nothing transmitted. PRIVACY.md says so.
- **Release/branch workflow — gitflow.** Branches: **`main`** = production (tagged releases ONLY, always
  shippable) · **`dev`** = develop/integration · **`feature/<slug>`** (off `dev`) · **`hotfix/<slug>`** (off
  `main`) · optional **`release/<x.y>`** (stabilize before a big minor/major). **Bump level is decided by
  Conventional-Commit type, NOT by batch size** (`node scripts/bump.mjs <major|minor|patch>`):
  `feat:` → **minor** · `fix:`/`perf:`/`refactor:`/`docs:`/`chore:` → **patch** · `!`/BREAKING → **major**.
  ONE release = ONE coherent theme — do NOT lump unrelated fixes into a minor.
  - **Feature flow:** `feature/<slug>` off `dev` → squash-PR into `dev` → accumulate. When a theme is ready,
    one **`dev → main` PR** (`Closes #N`, "Review points") → squash-merge → on `main` bump **minor** (or major)
    + `git tag -a v<x>` → push tag (release.yml publishes) → resync `dev` to `main`.
  - **Hotfix flow (urgent prod fix — keeps minors clean):** `hotfix/<slug>` off **`main`** → PR into `main` →
    bump **patch** + tag IMMEDIATELY (do NOT wait for / bundle into the next minor) → merge `main` back into
    `dev`. A standalone non-urgent fix is still its OWN `fix:` patch PR, not a passenger on a feature minor.
  - Every PR is green on CI (eval/lint/validate, Ubuntu+Windows) before merge; resyncing `dev` to `main` after
    a squash needs `git push origin main:dev --force-with-lease` (ask before force-pushing the shared branch).
  **No npm publish from this repo** — the gamedev-log-analyzer npm
  package is maintained in `../rider-mcp-enforcer`; the bundled copy here is a static mirror. To refresh it
  run **`node scripts/sync-gamedev.mjs`** — it mirrors the source AND bumps the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  gamedev entry to match (never hand-copy: `claude plugin validate . --strict` / CI `validate` fails if
  `plugins[].version` ≠ the plugin's `plugin.json` version, and the eval guards this parity). Use Edit/Write
  for files + short `git`/`gh` Bash (no heredocs/`node -e` — they break tool calls). `timeout: 300000` for network Bash.
- **Reuse, don't reinvent.** Pull patterns from `../rider-mcp-enforcer` and `../gamedev-log-analyzer`
  (token-cap, savings ledger, grep-block hook, routing skill, CLI-first, release CI).

## Backends
- **clangd** (C++): needs `compile_commands.json` (Unreal: UBT `-mode=GenerateClangDatabase`).
  **✅ live-verified** (search/refs/def) via VS-bundled clangd (`…/VC/Tools/Llvm/bin/clangd.exe`).
  clangd indexes async → `afterInit` (`backends/index.js`) opens the compile_commands TUs + nearby
  headers (cap 100) and waits for `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` before the first query. CAVEAT: a
  compile DB without include dirs → system/3rd-party headers fail to resolve → only header-free symbols
  index; UBT-generated DBs include the paths. NO compile_commands.json at all (a `.uproject`-only project
  still picks clangd) → `compileDbAdvisory`/`hasCompileDb` (core.js) prepend a one-time UBT-generate advisory
  to clangd results AND vts_setup warns proactively; `search_symbol` then falls back to a literal text search
  (same path as ts/py 0-results) so the name is still locatable without a DB. The user's CHOICE: tool
  **`vts_gen_compile_db`** (CLI `vts gen-compile-db`) builds the UBT `GenerateClangDatabase` command (auto:
  .uproject→target `<Name>Editor`, engine root via `VTS_UE_ROOT`/arg/walk-up, `-Compiler=VisualCpp`) — DRY
  RUN by default (prints the exact command), `apply=true` runs it (`VTS_UBT_TIMEOUT_MS`). APPLY runs the
  `.bat` THROUGH THE SHELL (`execSync(plan.cmdline)`) — Node refuses to spawn `.bat`/`.cmd` directly
  (EINVAL, CVE-2024-27980 hardening; found live on the real UE depot). The DB lands **OUT-OF-TREE by
  default**: `dbDirFor(root)` (backends/index.js) = `~/.vs-token-safer/db/<basename>-<sha1[:10]>`
  (`VTS_DB_DIR` overrides the base); `resolveCdbDir(root)` (in-tree shallow scan WINS, else the
  out-of-tree home) feeds clangd's `--compile-commands-dir`, `detect`, `afterInit`, and `hasCompileDb` —
  and clangd writes its `.cache/` index NEXT TO the CDB, so the whole artifact set stays outside the
  source tree (nothing for git or `p4 reconcile`). `inTree=true` keeps the classic project-root layout,
  protected by `ensureDbIgnored(root)`: appends `compile_commands.json` + `.cache/` to `.gitignore` (git
  work tree) or an existing P4IGNORE/.p4ignore (walk-UP to the depot root — the live depot keeps it 2
  levels above the game dir; read-only/versioned file → exact `p4 edit` instructions instead). The
  engine-root DB copy is removed after the move in both modes. `genCompileDbPlan` + `ensureDbIgnored` +
  `dbDirFor` + `resolveCdbDir` exported for the eval. **✅ real UE 5.x project live-verified end-to-end**
  (`search_symbol` returned the game `UCLASS` + its `*.generated.h` symbols as `file:line`):
  - `GenerateClangDatabase` needs **`-Compiler=VisualCpp`** when the targets build with clang-cl — else
    clang-toolchain validation fails (`Unable to find valid <ver> C++ toolchain for Clang x64`). Override
    → `Result: Succeeded`, ~26k-entry DB.
  - **CLANGD VERSION MATTERS (root cause of the long stall hunt).** VS-bundled clangd **19.1.5 DEADLOCKS**
    on a real UE TU in LSP-server mode: `clangd --check` parses it in ~19s, but every async path (didOpen
    *and* background-index) never finishes (>250s, 0 symbols). **Standalone clangd 22.1.6 parses the same
    TU in ~13s and returns symbols.** So it's an upstream clangd 19.x bug, not a vts/glue bug. Fix: use
    clangd ≥ `MIN_CLANGD` (22) — `backends/index.js` probes `clangd --version` and `core.js` prepends a
    one-time advisory if it's older. Isolation proved engine headers (CoreMinimal, GameplayTagContainer)
    parse fine; only the full game-TU header chain trips 19.x. The clangd path is a first-class CONFIG key
    `clangdCmd` (in `CONFIG_KEYS`; `vts_setup`/`vts setup --clangdCmd <path>` persists it, so a setup click
    survives restart WITHOUT editing the user's OS env) — `backends/index.js` `cfgCmd()` resolves it as
    `VTS_CLANGD_CMD` env > config `clangdCmd` > `clangd`. Eval guard 57. The `commands/setup.md` flow now
    presents unmet C++ prereqs (no compile DB / no clangd ≥ 22) as `AskUserQuestion` clickable choices, not a
    free-text prompt — generate-DB routes to `vts_setup { genCompileDb }`, clangd path to `{ clangdCmd }`.
  - Secondary tuning for cold/large indexes: `VTS_LSP_TIMEOUT_MS` (request timeout), `VTS_LSP_INDEX_WAIT_MS`
    (afterInit waits for `$/progress` index-ready), `VTS_CLANGD_OPEN_CAP` (warm-up open cap).
  - **LATENCY (why it felt slower than a warm IDE like Rider — root-caused on a real 26k-TU UE project, all
    fixed; THE BIG ONE is #3):** (1) clangd's background-index priority defaults to `background` =
    MINIMUM/idle-CPU-only → we pass **`--background-index-priority=normal`** (`VTS_CLANGD_INDEX_PRIORITY`) +
    **`-j=`**`cores-1` (`VTS_CLANGD_JOBS`). (2) afterInit `didOpen`s up to `VTS_CLANGD_OPEN_CAP` (100) UE TUs
    and clangd PARSES each — when a persisted index exists, **`hasPersistedIndex`** (checks
    `<cdbDir>/.cache/clangd/index/*.idx`) shrinks the open-set to `VTS_CLANGD_WARM_CAP_PERSISTED` (8). (3)
    **the killer**: afterInit waited for clangd's FULL background-index completion (`$/progress kind:end`,
    up to `VTS_LSP_INDEX_WAIT_MS`) before the first query — but workspace/symbol answers from the loaded
    static shards LONG before the full re-validation finishes. **Measured: 369s (full wait) vs 51s (static
    index loaded) = 7×.** FIX: when persisted, afterInit no longer blocks — it returns after a short floor
    (`VTS_CLANGD_PERSISTED_FLOOR_MS`, 3s) and flips `client.indexLoaded` on `$/progress end`; the QUERY then
    POLLS (`symbolReady` in core.js: re-issue with backoff, capped `VTS_CLANGD_PERSISTED_WAIT_MS` 60s) and
    returns the INSTANT the sought symbol's shard loads — not at a fixed deadline. Once `indexLoaded`, an
    empty result is genuine (stop). Cold (no index) still BLOCKS on the build (a poll would just spin). Used
    by search_symbol + find_references-by-name. clangd stores
    `.cache/clangd` at the **cdbDir** (it honors `--compile-commands-dir` as the index ROOT — live-verified:
    6166 shards under the out-of-tree dir, none in the source tree), so the out-of-tree layout keeps the
    index out of VCS too. Rider is fast because it proxies a RUNNING IDE; our MCP server keeps clangd alive
    so the per-spawn cost is paid once per session (the one-shot CLI pays it each call).
- **roslyn** (C#/.NET): `.sln/.csproj`. **✅ live-verified** against **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer**
  (the real VS / C# Dev Kit engine), auto-detected from the VS Code C# extension bundle + its net10
  runtime; opens the workspace via `solution/open`/`project/open` then waits for
  `workspace/projectInitializationComplete` (see `backends/index.js` `afterInit`, `lsp.js`
  `waitForNotification`). `csharp-ls` is the fallback. Overrides: `VTS_ROSLYN_DLL`, `VTS_ROSLYN_CMD/ARGS`.
- **typescript** (JS/TS): `typescript-language-server --stdio` (wraps tsserver). Install
  `npm i -g typescript-language-server typescript`. Detect: tsconfig/jsconfig/package.json or `*.ts/js`.
  `afterInit` opens top-N (`VTS_TS_OPEN_CAP`, 60) likely-query files; `workspace/symbol` answers
  project-wide. Override `VTS_TS_CMD/ARGS`. **✅ live-verified by dogfooding vts on its own `server/*.js`**
  (search_symbol/find_references/document_symbols returned correct `file:line` incl. cross-file refs).
- **pyright** (Python): `pyright-langserver --stdio` (`npm i -g pyright`). Detect:
  pyproject/setup.py/setup.cfg/requirements/Pipfile or `*.py`. `afterInit` opens top-N
  (`VTS_PY_OPEN_CAP`). Override `VTS_PY_CMD/ARGS`. Same generic glue as typescript.
- **document_symbols outline filter (dogfood-found).** `fmtDocSymbols` hides outline noise by default —
  anonymous callbacks/function-expressions (`arr.map() callback`, `<function>`) and NESTED var/const/key
  locals (kinds 13/14/20 at depth>0) — keeping the declaration structure (classes/functions/methods/
  fields/types). A `(N local/anonymous hidden …)` note shows the count; `VTS_OUTLINE_RAW=1` shows all,
  `VTS_OUTLINE_DEPTH` caps nesting (default 4). Live: a 105-symbol warmset.js outline → 32. Token + clarity win.
- **output cap v2 — collapse repetition (caveman-inspired).** `fmtLocations` (find_references + any
  multi-location result) no longer prints one line PER location — a refs-heavy result repeats the same long
  path on every row. `compactLocationLines` groups by FILE (one row, all line numbers joined/deduped/sorted:
  `Foo.cpp:42,88,120`) then `commonDirPrefix` factors the shared directory tree out once (`under <prefix>/`
  + relative tails). Every location preserved + recoverable (full path = prefix + tail). Est. ~4× (coalesce)
  → ~10× (prefix) on a deep UE refs result. `VTS_COMPACT_RESULTS=0` restores the classic `  @ path:line`.
  fmtSymbols/search_text keep per-row (distinct payload each). eval guard 47.
- **ts/py search_symbol fallback (dogfood-found).** tsserver/pyright answer `workspace/symbol` from
  OPEN/indexed files, so a symbol whose file the warm-up didn't open (or a non-exported local) returns 0.
  `search_symbol` then falls back to a bounded literal text search (`scanTextUnder`, labeled "Literal text
  matches"; clangd/roslyn index the whole project so they skip it). Also `scanTextUnder` (`search_text`) now
  scans `js/ts/tsx/.../py/pyi` — it was C/C++/C# only, a real bug once the JS/TS/Py backends landed.
- **Windows spawn:** npm-installed JS LSPs are `.cmd` shims → `winShell:true` on those backends spawns
  through a shell (clangd.exe / dotnet host stay shell:false to survive paths with spaces). `langIdForPath`
  (lsp.js) maps file ext → LSP languageId so one backend serves several extensions.
- **grep-block hook** now covers `js/jsx/mjs/cjs/ts/tsx/mts/cts/py/pyi` too (default on, per user) so vts
  self-enforces while we develop it; `VTS_ENFORCE=0` still the escape hatch. matcher is `Bash|Grep`: Bash
  code-grep BLOCKS (vts default), the built-in **Grep tool** WARNS-only (never block — it's the fallback),
  and a search aimed at a LOG (`Logs/` dir or `.log/.jsonl`) WARNS+allows with a gamedev-log pointer.
- **log steer (rider 0.2.8 parity).** `core.js` `looksLogTarget(a)` (path/projectPath/paths vs `LOG_PATHISH`)
  appends a one-line gamedev-log pointer (`LOG_STEER`) to ANY tool result whose target is a log; empty
  symbol results carry `EMPTY_HINT` (stale-index + definitions-only + log→gamedev-log), find_files/search_text
  empties carry `LOG_EMPTY_HINT`. Additive text only, never blocks. Mirrors `../rider-mcp-enforcer` proxy steer.
- **search_text → symbol steer (dogfood-found).** `core.js` `symbolHuntInText(q)` pulls the hunted NAME from a
  TEXT query that is really a symbol/class usage hunt — a `Foo<Bar>` template arg (the `<Type>` wins), a `::`
  scope, or the longest CamelCase/snake identifier; null for `TODO|FIXME`/prose. `textSymbolSteer(q,truncated)`
  appends a one-line nudge to `find_references symbol="X"` / `search_symbol q="X"` (semantic, COMPLETE, no 4s
  time-box, ~10–20× smaller) — fires only on a CODE scan (`!docs && !path`) when the result was TRUNCATED or the
  query carries a `<>`/`::` cue (low-noise: a bare-CamelCase text search that completed isn't nagged). The
  EMPTY-but-timed-out branch also steers AND flags that a `0` from a truncated walk is NOT conclusive (a real 0
  and an unreached-in-time 0 are indistinguishable — `find_references` resolves which). `VTS_TEXT_STEER=0` off.
  Born from a live case: the model used `search_text "FindComponentByClass<UMyComp>"` → 8-of-49 time-boxed slice;
  `find_references` returned all 49 at 19×. Eval guard 58 (`symbolHuntInText` unit + integration).

## Next (see wiki "Status and TODO")
P1 DONE: core rename, `index.js`/`sdk.js`/`ensure-deps.mjs`, grep-block `hooks/`, `skills/`+`commands/`,
`.claude-plugin/*`+`.mcp.json`, README EN/KO + PRIVACY/SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING/CoC/BENCHMARK, `.github` CI,
lint/prettier configs, `bump.mjs`. P1 remaining: `gh repo create JSungMin/vs-token-safer --public` +
push; optionally **bundle gamedev-log-analyzer** as a 2nd marketplace plugin. P2: live-verify clangd
then roslyn on real projects.
